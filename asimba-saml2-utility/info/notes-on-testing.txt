Notes on testing
====================

2014/07/16:
When creating Unit Tests for testing the GoogleAppsUnspecifiedFormatHandler class, there have been
made some extra dependencies in the pom.xml file to deal with in the 'test'-scope of the project.

Mockito is used for mocking, PowerMock is used to be able to mock static/singleton classes.

The dependencies for testing, are:
- org.mockito:mockito-all
- org.powermock:powermock-module-junit4
- org.powermock:powermock-api-mockito


2014/07/16:
To enable configurable logging for the Unit-tests, the ch.qos.logback:logback-classic artifact
was added to the 'test'-scope of the project. This was done to override the default SimpleLogger
logger class, that does not support TRACE or DEBUG level logging.
The test-scoped logger is configured in /src/test/resources/logback.xml
