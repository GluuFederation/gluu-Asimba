Notes for Maven configuration of asimba-idp-profile-aselect
===========================================================

In this overview:
- xalan dependencies fixed
- xml-apis dependencies fixed



* Dependency on xalan

The artifacts rampart and rampart-core depend transitively on
org.apache.xalan:xalan:pom:2.7.1
This artifact is not available in the central Maven repository.

On the other hand, the xalan:xalan:pom:2.7.1 artifact (note the
different 'groupId') *is* available. There is a compile-time
transitive dependency on this library (by opensaml).

This conflicts with eachother, and as such, the non-resolving
xalan dependency from rampart is explicitly excluded.




* xml-apis 1.4.01 dependencies fixed

Like the xalan problem, there was a dependency on
xerces:xml-apis:pom:1.4.01
from opensaml-2.5.1. The groupname is invalid.

This is solved by changing in opensaml-2.5.1-1 (note the -1 version).
