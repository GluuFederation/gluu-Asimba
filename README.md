# gluu-Asimba 

This is Gluu's fork of [the Asimba project](http://www.asimba.org/site/)

It is currently a component of the [Gluu Server](http://gluu.org), used for "inbound SAML"--a use case where a company needs to normalize the process to onboard SAML identity providers, and to provide one SAML SP metadata file to front end a complex security infrastructure.

Please note that this project is [Affero License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License) which has been maintained since Asimba forked the original code. 

For more information about use of this component, see Gluu Server [documentation](https://gluu.org/docs/integrate/inbound-saml).

Also note that if you have questions about Asmiba, please register and post on Gluu's [Support Forum](https://support.gluu.org). Only post Github issues if you are pretty sure you are reporting a bug in the software.
